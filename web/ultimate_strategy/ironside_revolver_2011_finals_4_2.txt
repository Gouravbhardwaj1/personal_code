<p>Ironside sets up in their ho stack for the first time since 1-0.

<p>They run a different play this time, though. The three cutters nearest to the camera all break away from the disc, as Alex Kapinos, from the far side, makes a cut across the field for an easy 20 yard gain.

<p>As soon as Kapinos catches the disc, Jim Foster breaks inside from the wing, leaving a nice lane for Kapinos to look for Prial breaking deep.

<p>Revolver stops the throw because Kapinos' marker recognizes the force side huck lane, and cheats out to stop huck for just one stall count. Since Prial’s cut comes from pretty deep, Kapinos is forced to holster the throw.

<p>After a pick and a foul, followed by some action that isn't on the tape, we see that Boston has an interesting setup.

<p>They don’t have a single player within 20 yards of the disc! A few plays ago, we saw how Revolver likes to open up downfield space by clearing all their cutters behind the disc; here we can see that Boston wants to keep the space in front of their stack open to facilitate the big dump-swing plays that keep their offense alive and moving. The location and use of space by each offense says a lot about the different ways they like to work.

<p>From this position, Stubbs sees Josh Markette breaking deep from the middle of the stack and launches a huck to him. Off screen to the right, Mac Taylor sees it happening, poaches from his last back position, and easily Ds the much smaller Markette. Revolver manages to get the poach D that the Ironside couldn't at 1-0.

<p>Revolver gets the disc on the goal line sideline, and Ironside sets the trap force. Revolver sets up in an “L-stack”, which is basically a vertical stack moved off to the weak side of the field, leaving space for an iso cutter. In this case, Mac Taylor is the iso and does some nice work to get open on Prial.

<p>He picks up about 20 yards.

<p>After this cut, the Revolver defensive O begins to break down. Following some non-enlightening foul, travel and stall calls, the Boston O line buckles down and gets the disc back on a high stall count handblock by Matt Rebholz.

<p>Ironside sets up after the turn in their vert stack, again with nobody behind the disc. This time, we get to see how the handler motion in their dump-less vertical stack works.

<p>Taylor cuts to the dump spot from the front of the stack, allowing Rebholz to get him a break ahead of the disc and in an excellent position to turn and swing to Foster, who makes an swing cut for an easy 20 yards.

<p>By clearing the space where a vert stack offense normally keeps their dump, Ironside hopes to put their dump cutter in a more dangerous position, where a mistake by the defender potentially leaves him vulnerable to an open force-side huck. Furthermore, it makes it more likely that their dump catches the disc ahead of the thrower on his dump cut, making it easier for the offense to gain yards on the dump and swing instead of being stalemated.

<p>Foster gets the disc back to Rebholz, who lasers a blade to Prial. Goal Ironside.
