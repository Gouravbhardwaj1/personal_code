<p>Ironside sets up in a ho stack, but all of the cutters bar Stubbs move slowly up the field. This leaves Stubbs completely isolated, and he takes advantage.

<p>He’s been Ironside’s first look all game, so he runs up, fakes the in cut, and jets deep. There’s no help for Revolver this time, and Stubbs is open by about 10 yards by the time he reaches Rebholz’ excellent backhand bomb.

<p>Ironside equals Revolver’s easy goal, and now both defenses are reeling.
