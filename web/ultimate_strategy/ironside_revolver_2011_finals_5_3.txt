<p>Ironside again brings out its horizontal stack, and runs the same play as they started to on the second point of the game.

<p>Revolver comes out in a very standard flick force man-to-man defense, and Ironside runs a basic horizontal stack play. Peter Prial cuts flat across to the break side, while Stubbs clears space out and makes an in cut towards the disc. Ironside is trying to set up Stubbs’ flick huck to their best cutter, Peter Prial.

<p>Stubbs gets the disc, but Revolver prevents his huck to Prial (offscreen, so I can't be sure how). Ironside works the disc to the end zone line, but unfortunately most of the action in this point takes place offscreen to the right.

<p>Once they reach the end zone, they switch from their horizontal stack to their vertical stack.

<p>Note how well the stack is contained. Considering that the disc is live and in play at this point, their discipline is remarkable.

<p>Their good stack set helps them score, as Markette's defender is so worried about Rebholz hitting him with an IO that Markette makes the easy force side goal cut and receives the throw.

<p>It seems like the Ironside offense has finally settled into this game, after having given up two breaks. This is their smoothest and easiest point of the game so far, and they’ve got to be hoping that their defense can bring them back into this game.
