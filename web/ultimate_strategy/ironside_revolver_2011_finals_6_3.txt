<p>Ironside sets up with a backhand force, and Revolver has again disguised their iso stack, this time with a vertical set. As the disc comes in, everybody immediately breaks for the force side except for Devon Anderson.

<p>Anderson sets up in and to the breakside, Foster bites on the in fake, Anderson goes deep and there’s no help for Ironside. Easy goal for Revolver.
