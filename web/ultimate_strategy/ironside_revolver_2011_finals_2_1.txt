<p>Boston comes out for their second offensive point in a vertical stack pushed towards the break side, with two players out in the lane.

<p>Revolver has again pushed the dump defender out to double team the thrower for a few seconds. They're still backing Ironside, but playing them a bit more aggressively in the vert stack than they did in the horizontal, relying on deep help from the back.

<p>Josh “Cricket” Markette makes the first cut into the force side space, and manages to gain about 20 yards. The Revolver defender does a good job of making the cut difficult, and manages to push him almost all the way to the flick sideline.

<p>The action in this vertical stack is from the front, as the play is looking for Danny Clark long.

<p>Clark goes deep, but there’s plenty of help for Revolver, and very little room to work with. Stubbs sees his defender turn his head to look at Clark, and takes advantage for an easy 25 yard in.

<p>Ironside’s now in the classic vertical stack, separating the open space on the field into force side and break side halves.

<p>Clark returns from his deep cut, sees he isn't open, and so he clears out deep. Kapinos, meanwhile, attacks the open space with a textbook vertical stack cut from the back.

<p>After Kapinos’ cut is successful, but the next cut isn’t, Ironside execute the dump and swing to get the disc to Stubbs on the breakside and start all over again.

<p>Above is a typical Ironside vertical stack set. It's an interesting wrinkle that they don't want to keep a dump parallel or behind the thrower. Instead, they try to get the disc to the front of the stack cutting to the break side. Failing that, the second in the stack breaks to what should be a large, unoccupied space on the force side.

<p>In this case, Matt Rebholz cuts to the break side, but Stubbs can't get it to him, so he hits Jacob Taylor cutting to the force side.

<p>The Revolver man defense does a good job of pressuring Ironside's throwers and receivers, but Ironside's vertical stack offense is the inheritor of DoG's legendary possession offense. Instead of taking chances downfield, they pride themselves on completing lots of passes under pressure.

<p>This time it's successful, as they work the disc around with dumps and swings until Rebholz fools his defender into thinking he's headed to the dump, and beats him upline for the score.
