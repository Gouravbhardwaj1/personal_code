<p>Ironside again comes out in a vertical stack, and they run the same play as on their previous offensive set. This time, it’s Markette out from the front, but Stubbs is the in cut from the back again.

<p>An excellent mark by the Revolver defender, who appears to be marking straight up, prevents Rebholz from getting the disc to Stubbs, so Boston goes to their basic dump and swing, getting the disc to Prial on the sideline.

<p>Revolver has also caused Boston's offense to struggle off the pull here by fronting Boston's receivers. Look at all the space they're leaving them deep, just daring them to put up the long shot.

<p>Another dump and swing later, Stubbs manages to get open for an in cut despite his defender fronting him.

<p>Stubbs had set up his in cut with a big out fake from the back of the stack. His defender, who was fronting, was scared of exactly that and overreacted; Stubbs beat him in once he did. Peter Prial read his cut perfectly, and set up his own out cut with a big in fake. The two are timed to perfection, and Stubbs launches a huge, flat, flick which Prial pulls down in the middle of the endzone, 2 steps ahead of his marker.

<p>It's <em>perfect</em> vertical stack cutting, so I've embedded just this part of the video below, so you can know what vert stack cutting should look like:

<p>Unfortunately for Boston, there was a pick in the morass of handlers next to Stubbs just before he received the disc. It doesn't affect the play, but due to continuation, the disc goes back to Stubbs.

<p>I think that the Nexgen cameras miss the rest of Stubbs’ possession, because when we come back from replays, we find that he’s been stalled.

<p>After some hard Boston D from the O line, and several fouls, Revolver’s D line punches it in for their second break. (There’s not much to talk about in the Revolver D possession, it was pretty ugly and broken up by 3 Boston marking fouls, including a TMF.)

<p>It’s now 4-1 Revolver, and they’re up two breaks.
