<p>Revolver comes out in a horizontal stack and runs the same play they did on the first point of the game.

<p>The two strong-side cutters (who I can’t recognize in the video, unfortunately) cross each other, hoping to get Beau isolated into a big space in the middle.

<p>This time, Boston is able to stop the first throw with a handler poach and some good man D, so Revolver pulls the break side cutters across the field and over to the force sideline, creating a breakside iso space for Beau and Watson.

<p>In the above screenshot, we can see clearly that Revolver's ho stack is a bit of a fake out; they're just disguising the iso stack that they want to play, and now they've got Beau and Watson isolated with lots of space.

<p>It's interesting that one Ironside defender (Christian Foster, I think) has recognized the iso and plays far off his inactive player, while the other two defending in the iso stack are playing their men fairly tight.

<p>Bart Watson makes a long horizontal cut into the cutting space, almost all the way over into the stack. Since Ironside has finally effectively slowed down Revolver's offense, we can use this opportunity to get some insight into how Revolver's offense works.

<p>As Watson moves over to the force side, where the stack is, the stack cutters clear across the field. Goldstein's mark (not sure who) clears behind the thrower, somebody else cuts across the field to dead sideline space, and Wiseman makes a deep cut. The effect of all this motion is that they've reversed the iso stack, again leaving Beau with a ton of room to work.

<p>Their offense seems designed exactly to play against the weaknesses of Boston's relatively straight man D. When Revolver sends 5 of their players into dead space, and Boston defenders stay with them, it leaves Watson and Kittredge each on an island with one guy. Guarding Bart or Beau without help is an impossible task, and Revolver to this point has consistently taken advantage of this fact.

<p>Above, we can see Goldstein starts hanging out in the lane, leaving his inactive guy uncovered. After he does so for a few seconds, he gets guilty and moves back to cover his guy; Watson hits Beau coming across the field as soon as he leaves.

<p>All that said, Boston has done a very good job defending Revolver up to this point. Their handler poach stopped Revolver's play off the pull, and Watson and Beau were limited to mostly non-threatening short horizontal cuts.

<p>Beau traveled after he caught the disc from Watson. On the restart, Wiseman cuts out when Beau thinks he’s going to cut in, and Beau throws the Revolver offense's first turn to Jack Hatchett.

<p>The Ironside offense sets up quickly after the turn in their base vertical stack, and Hatchett realizes that he is unguarded.

<p>Beau, guarding the last back in the stack, sees the open player, pulls off his guy, and the throw is a bit short. The outcome of a 1v1 against Beau is predictable, and the Ironside defensive offense loses its first chance with the disc after just one throw.

<p>Revolver sets up in an iso stack, with Robbie Cahill (I think) isolated on the break side.

<p>After Watson makes it look easy to throw a flat laser to the break side through a 2-man cup, Revolver’s offense runs into some trouble.

<p>The cut looks like it should be Wiseman’s, followed deeper by Ashlin Joye, in a play straight out of the textbook. Wiseman makes his cut, but Watson attacks from the handler spot, and the two clog the lane, preventing any throw to either of them.

<p>Surprisingly for a team that has so far been so good at leaving lots of space in front of its throwers, Revolver clogs upfield as it clears the backfield. Joye reads the field well, sees the empty backfield, and gets the disc on a comeback.

<p>Once he does, the Revolver offense starts to click again, creating a big space on the force side for Watson to cut into.

<p>Before Joye even gets the disc, Joel Schlachet catches his defender overplaying the dump, and takes off down the field. Once Watson cathes the disc in a power position, he easily bombs it to Schlachet who has run nearly a full 70 yards and has a 3 step cushion. <em>(Young handlers of the world: take note of Schlachet's play here.)</em>

<p>Last point, a nearly-exact replica of this situation occurred with the teams reversed. Recall that Josh Markette got open deep, Stubbs threw it to him, but Cahill poached off the end of the stack for the D.

<p>This time, a Revolver handler has gotten open deep, and Boston has a player positioned in a place where he could help.

<p>Christian Foster intelligently recognizes that his guy has gone into inactive space, and poaches into the deep lane. Unfortunately for Ironside, he doesn't seem to catch Schlachet passing him in his peripheral vision, and makes no move to help out Jacob Goldstein with the deep cut.

<p>I think that we can mark this as an advantage of Revolver's dynamic iso stack against Ironside's more static vertical stack: it's much more difficult for Boston's players to make intelligent poaches because their guys are moving more often, giving them more to think about.

<p>The Ironside D had its best point so far, and earned its first turn. An unfortunate huck decision cost them the disc, and Revolver made them pay. It's now 5-2 instead of 4-3.
