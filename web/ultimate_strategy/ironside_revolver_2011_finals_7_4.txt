<p>This point is so ugly, with so many stoppages, that I’m just going to show you Cassidy Rasmussen’s sky for a goal.

<p>The only strategically interesting notes on this point are that Ironside has switched the very tall Mahoney onto Watson to try and stop him, and they have put Prial on the D line for this one.

<p>The Boston D line nearly got a second chance with the disc, as Cahill’s throw was a poor decision, but Rasmussen’s grab salvaged the point for Revolver.
