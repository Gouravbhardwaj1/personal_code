<p>This time, Revolver come out in a side stack, looking to isolate Wiseman in and Beau out.

<p>Boston foils the plan by setting up their handler defenders in a cup, just to stop the first throw. Instead of going to one of the open dumps, Revolver moves the disc right where Boston want them, stuck on the break sideline just beyond their own endzone.

<p>When the pull play fails, the extremely disciplined Revolver cutters recognize that the disc is on the same side as their stack, so they move out to the break side of the field, giving Josh Wiseman another chance to cut and space to cut into.

<p>Cahill, however, thinks it’s too late in the count and looks for Watson for the dump. They miscommunicate, and Cahill lofts a high release backhand into the cutting lane at nobody in particular.

<p>Jacob Goldstein is alert, sees the miscommunication, and goes all the way across the field into the cutting lane to try and intercept the pass. Revolver are very fortunate when Wiseman gets to the disc a moment before Goldstein, and maintain possession.

<p>At this point, we get a break in the play as Goldstein fouled Wiseman, and we’re seeing the Boston defense at their best. They’ve forced Revolver out of their pull play, into the force side trap, and into a miscommunication that nearly created a turn.

<p>The stoppage gives us a chance to take a look at Revolver’s flow offense; so far we’ve only seen their pull plays or short yardage sets. They come out looking like they're in a pretty basic horizontal stack.

<p>As soon as the offense gets flowing, an interesting wrinkle appears. Whereas cutters in most horizontal stacks will recycle out immediately when their in cuts fail, Revolver tends to gather players behind the handlers:

<p>In this shot, the disc, marked in red, is headed from Wiseman to Sherwood. Instead of the usual set with 3 men behind and 4 ahead of the disc, Revolver will only have a single player ahead of the disc after Sherwood catches it.

<p>I don’t believe this is accidental, but rather a strategical wrinkle that Revolver uses to open up huge amounts of space for their cutters to work with, and to enable deep cuts from behind the person with the disc, which are much easier to hit than deep cuts from ahead of it.

<p>In fact, after Revolver works it up the field another few throws, it happens again.

<p>After a few throws, including a very cheeky throw across the field, between several defenders, by Bart Watson, Revolver has scored again.

<p>This point shows us a lot. We see how Revolver sets up one of their pull plays, and how they work the disc after it fails. We see that one way that Revolver opens up so much space downfield is by waiting to recycle failed in-cuts until after the disc has moved upfield, giving the remaining cutters huge areas of the field to work with and dump cutters plenty of upfield space to threaten with.

<p>We’ve also seen that the Boston D is capable of pressuring the Revolver offense. Although they got away with it here by a narrow margin, that pressure is eventually going to help Boston work back into the game.
