<p>Ironside receives for the first time, and sets up in a more conventional 
horizontal stack.

<p>Prial and Stubbs are the inside cutters, and the two wing cutters are waiting to work off them. Revolver is backing the cutters just as Ironside did, though they're playing a bit closer.

<p>Revolver have floated the force-side handler defender into the middle of the 
field for 2 or 3 seconds, just to slow down the pull play. Ironside used a 
similar strategy, but this defender plays much farther out in the lane than 
Ironside's floater did.

<p>Prial makes a good first cut, but Ironside's first chance on offense is cut 
short when Jon Levy of Revolver makes an outstanding diving point block on Matt 
Rebholz. I think it's easy to put too much blame on the thrower here; he made a 
shoulder fake which should probably have been better, and he didn't step all 
the way out, but the defender really makes a terrific read and perfectly times 
his layout.

<p>Revolver sets up for their chance with a deep vertical stack entirely 
contained in the end zone.

<p>Revolver works it to the goal line on a break throw and a bit of switch confusion by the Ironside D, but Ironside does a good job recovering and sticks Revolver in the corner. By now, Revolver has moved to a horizontal stack, and gotten the disc to Mark Sherwood, one of their excellent handlers.

<p>The cutter on the cone side clears out, Levy catches his marker napping, 
cuts to the cone, and Sherwood breaks the mark for the first break point of the 
game and a 2-0 lead.

<p>There's not a lot that's tactically interesting in this point. Ironside came 
out in a standard ho stack, Revolver made a great defensive play and did their 
job by getting it into the end zone.
